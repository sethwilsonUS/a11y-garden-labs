Welcome to A11y Garden Labs! This is the home base for a growing family of accessibility-focused projects — tools built by and for people who believe access is a matter of dignity, not convenience.

## What is A11y Garden Labs?

A11y Garden Labs is a small, experiment-friendly studio focused on accessibility, education, and connection. We create open, human-centered tools that help people explore information, test and improve website accessibility, and find communities of faith where they can fully belong.

## Our Projects

- **A11y Garden** — A friendly, approachable accessibility audit tool for everyday developers.
- **Curio Garden** — A listening-first way to wander through knowledge, turning Wikipedia articles into accessible audio experiences.
