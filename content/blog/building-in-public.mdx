Building software as a legally blind developer comes with its own set of challenges and unexpected advantages. In this post, I want to share a bit about what it's like to build these tools — and why I'm doing it in public.

## Why Build in Public?

Accessibility is too important to develop behind closed doors. The people who need these tools should have a voice in how they're built. Building in public means sharing the wins, the mistakes, and the lessons along the way.

## What's Next

I'll be documenting the journey here on this blog — technical deep dives, accessibility insights, and the occasional reflection on faith and purpose.
